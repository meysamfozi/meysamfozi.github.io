* I am a B.Sc. graduated student in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://sbu.ac.ir/Cols/CSE) at [Shahid Beheshti University](http://sbu.ac.ir/), advised by Dr. [Ramak Ghavamizadeh](https://sbu.ac.ir/Pages/Profiles.aspx?proffID=375537). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://meysamfozi.github.io/cv/)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of data science, particularly in big data, natwork analysis, deep learning, as well as their applications in information retrieval and natural language processing.
<!-- * I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). -->
